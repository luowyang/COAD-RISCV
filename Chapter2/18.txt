Suppose that we use no save or load.
First extract x5[16:11] with AND, then mask x6[31:26] by substracting x6[31:26].
addi x7, x0, 63     # x7 is the mask
slli x7, x7, 26     # move mask to x7[31:26]
slli x8, x5, 15     # move x5[16:11] to x8[31:26]
and  x8, x7, x8     # mask x8[31:26]
and  x9, x6, x7     # extract x6[31:26]
sub  x6, x6, x9     # mask x6[31:26]
add  x6, x6, x8     # substitute x6[31:26] by x5[16:11]
