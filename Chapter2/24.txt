1.
The loop will be executed 10 times, each time x6 will be decremented by 1 and x5 will be incremented by 2, so x5 will be 20

2.
while (i != 0) {
    i -= 1;
    acc += 2;
}

3.
loop will be executed N times, each time 4 instructions will be executed.
beq will be executed an extra time to find x6==x0.
So totaling 4N+1 times

4.
while (i >= 0) {
    i -= 1;
    acc += 2;
}
