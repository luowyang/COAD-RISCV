Both processor will get the shvar. If both of them decide that shvar should be updated, then they will try to overwrite shvar.
However, only one of them (suppose A) will succeed and return, while the other (suppose B) will fail and read shvar again.
If B decides that shvar still need to be updated, then it will try and succeed. Otherwise it will return, meaning that shvar is already the max.
Either case, shvar will be the maximum of its prevoius value and the values possessed by A and B.
