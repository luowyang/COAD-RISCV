If we have 128 registers, we will need 7 bits per register field.
If four times as many instructions are included, we will need 2 more bits for opcode and funct. 

1.
rd, rs1 and rs2 all need 7 bits, totaling 21bits.
Thus only 11 bits left for opcode and funct, however, they need 12.

2.
rd and rs1 both need 7 bits, 14 in total.
opcode and funct3 need 12 bits, leaving only 6 bits for immediate field.

3.
With more registers on hand, we could more easily allocate register without touching the memory,
we could also perform more complicated operations with the expanded instruction set,
thus less instructions are needed, which decreases the size of the assembly program.
However, with a small immediate field, we would be forced to perform more immediate shiftings and addings to get long immediates and addresses,
otherwise we will have to increase the length of instructions.
Either way, the program size might possibly increase.
