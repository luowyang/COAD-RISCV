1.
previous: time = 1.4n  * 250ps = 350n ps
present:  time = 1.05n * 300ps = 315n ps
ratio = 350/315 = 111%

2.
1.4n * 250 = (1 + x) * n * 300
1 + x = 1.167
0.167*n

3.
(1 + x) * n * 250 = (1 + y) * n * 300
1 + y = 0.833 * (1 + x)
0.833 * (1 + x) - 1

4.
0.833 * 1.075 - 1 < 0
impossible, because this would require that the pipeline could reduce the number of nops to negative

5.
0.833 * (1 + x) - 1 > 0
i.e. x > 0.2
